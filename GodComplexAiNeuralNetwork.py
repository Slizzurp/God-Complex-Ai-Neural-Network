# GOD COMPLEX AI NEURAL NETWORK
# Hierarchical AI architecture simulating divine intelligence
# This code is a simplified version of the God Complex AI system, focusing on the main pipeline.
# Install pyttsx3 for text-to-speech functionality
# Install numpy for numerical operations
# Install random for random choice generation
# Install re for regular expression operations
# This code simulates a complex AI system with a hierarchical structure,
# processing user queries through multiple layers of divine agents,
# ultimately delivering a synthesized response in both text and voice formats.

# Note: Ensure you have the necessary libraries installed and configured for text-to-speech functionality.
# This code is a conceptual simulation of a complex AI system with a hierarchical structure, processing user queries through multiple layers of divine agents, ultimately delivering a synthesized response in both text and voice formats.
# The system is designed to mimic a divine intelligence architecture, with each component representing a different aspect of knowledge and wisdom.
# The AI's responses are generated based on a combination of predefined knowledge bases, random selection, and structured processing, simulating a complex decision-making process akin to divine judgment.
# The final output is delivered in a user-friendly format, showcasing the AI's ability to communicate effectively and meaningfully.
